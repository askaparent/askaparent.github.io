Hello.

We're Paula and Nico, parents to Victor.

We found that much of the advice we were given, the books and blogs we read, the programs we saw on television all misrepresented the process of pregnancy and early parenthood and so we decided to document our experiences in the hope of helping other people in these situations. If writing this provides comfort or help to just one parent, I'll be delighted and proud of our work here.

We live in the south of England, worth noting because some of this may be specific to our circumstances, particularly NHS hospitals. Any government advice or statistics we present will be for the UK (or England and Wales, due to the devolved health services in Scotland and Northern Ireland) but hopefully it won't be too different to what goes on where you are. In any case, much of the experience of pregnancy, birth and parenthood is pretty universal.

Each section and chapter will be written from both the perspectives of mum and dad. Paula is a very instinctive parent, very intuitive and with strong empathy for the needs of Victor, keen to follow guidelines and to parent by the book. Nico is more analytical, believing in statistics and also the individuality of each baby and mother and so we will provide sometimes very different views on a situation. It will be for you to read our opinions and judge how best to look after your family.

Our opinions are just that - our own thoughts. We're not medical professionals and should never be relied on or given undue responsibility for your decisions. We cannot emphasise enough that we are not providing medical advice and therefore will accept no liability for the consequences of any decision you make after reading this.

With that said, make a cup of tea and get comfortable while you read this. Good luck to you and your family.

Paula, Nico and Victor
